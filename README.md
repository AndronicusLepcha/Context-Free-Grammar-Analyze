# Context-Free Grammar Analyzer

## Description

This open-source project is a tool for analyzing context-free grammar (CFG) productions. It allows users to:

- Detect and analyze left and right recursion in CFG productions.
- Identify alpha and beta components of productions.
- Gain insights into formal grammar structures and parsing.

The project is written in C and provides a set of functions for parsing and analyzing CFG productions. It's designed to assist with understanding formal grammars, particularly in the context of language processing, compiler construction, and parsing algorithms.

## Key Features

- Detection of left and right recursion in CFG productions.
- Extraction of alpha and beta components from productions.
- Code written in C for portability and efficiency.

## Usage

To use this tool, input your CFG production strings into the provided functions, and the tool will provide analysis results, including the presence of recursion and the alpha and beta components.
